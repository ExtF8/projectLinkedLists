# Linked Lists

## Introduction

This project is part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/javascript-linked-lists)<br />
and it focuses on implementing a basic linked list data structure in JavaScript.<br />
Linked lists are fundamental data structures used in computer science to store and manage collections of data efficiently.<br />
This project will serve as a foundational exercise in understanding linked lists and their operations.

### Features

- Append: Add a new node containing a value to the end of the list.
- Prepend: Add a new node containing a value to the start of the list.
- Size: Return the total number of nodes in the list.
- Head: Return the first node in the list.
- Tail: Return the last node in the list.
- At: Return the node at the given index.
- Pop: Remove the last element from the list.
- Contains: Check if a value is present in the list.
- Find: Return the index of the node containing a value.
- ToString: Represent the LinkedList objects as strings.
- InsertAt: Insert a new node with a provided value at the given index.
- RemoveAt: Remove the node at the given index.
- ListAllNodes: List all nodes in the linked list.
- ListAllNodesValues: List values of all nodes in the linked list.

### Technologies Used

-   JavaScript (ES6)
-   Node.js (for running JavaScript code)

## Usage

To get started with the LinkedList project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:
    ```
    git clone <repository-url>
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```
    cd linked-list-project
    ```
3. Running Tests:
- The `script.js` file contains test cases for the LinkedList implementation.
- To run the tests, use the following command:
    ```
    npm run start
    ```
- This command will execute the test script and display the results in the console.
- You can modify the `script.js` file to add or customize test cases as needed.
